Aoe_AmazonCdn
=============

Onepica_ImageCdn fork (only S3 support is left) with some customizations and improvements

## TODO
- Finish refactoring (merge Aoe_AmazonCdn_Model_Cache_Facade and Aoe_AmazonCdn_Model_Cdn_Adapter, better ideas?)
- Fix bug with generating thumbnails for downloaded images in wysiwyg -> select image window.
Currently thumbnails are generated randomly (like on 2-3 page load)
